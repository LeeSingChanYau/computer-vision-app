    description: `The Air Jordan II featured a full-length Air-Sole unit and a polyurethane midsole. 
    The shoe bore a similar silhouette to the Nike Air Python that would release the following year. 
    It featured a faux lizard skin and swooping lines that resembled the detailing of a sports car. 
    This design aesthetic would factor into the Air Jordan line later in the series. 
    The Air Jordan II was the first Jordan not to have the Nike swoosh on the upper, 
    though "Nike" was stitched across the heel counter. 
    Michael Jordan wore the Air Jordan II for a shortened 18 games in the 1986\u201387 season due to a broken foot.`,

    description: `Tinker Hatfield's design of the Air Jordan V was inspired by a fighter jet called the Supermarine Spitfire Mk VIII, 
    a World War II era British fighter jet.  Tinker used “teeth” on the midsole to give the AJ V an aggressive look, 
    making the parallel between the way Jordan played and the way fighter planes maneuvered and attacked the battlefield.
    The Air Jordan V had many firsts. It was the first Air Jordan to use a clear (or translucent) outsole, 
    it was the first shoe to make use of molded foam in the shoe's ankle collar, 
    it was also the first to be included with a unique set of lace locks. `,
